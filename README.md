# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Product-Reviews

## Abstract
This project aims to explore the effectiveness of using unsupervised learning techniques in Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) of product reviews. Specifically, the study utilises Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling and identifies sentiments in the reviews using (VADER). Further, the project uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) WordNet sentiment lexicon to extract positive and negative words. The proposed method returned consistent accuracy scores when tested separately for each topic, proving the reliability of the approach. The study's findings highlight the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in ABSA and provide insights for businesses to make data-driven decisions for improving their products and services.
